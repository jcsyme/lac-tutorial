Energy includes a range of variables and categories. Given the integrated nature of the energy sector, there are several "cross-subsector" categories required to construct the NemoMOD energy model. These categories include Fuels and Technologies. The dimensions required for the NemoMOD framework are available from the `NemoMOD Categories Documentation <https://sei-international.github.io/NemoMod.jl/stable/dimensions/>`_.
