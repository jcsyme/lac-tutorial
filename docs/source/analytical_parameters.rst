The **MODELNAMEHERE** is an Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) used to facilitate exploratory analyses. It is based on simple mathematical equations, leveraing an ability to explore a wide range of uncertainty to understand how different policy transformations affect future emissions, costs, and co-benefits.

Fundamentally, the model is based on the concept of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) (ADD REFERENCES).

Each run is based on a set of analytical parameters. These parameters are governed in a configuration file. The analytical parameters differ from model input variables in some key ways...
