Variable,Information,Variable Schema,Variable Type,Notes
Capacity Factor,"Fraction of time a technology is availble to operate. Can vary by region/technology--note that model variable input trajectories vary by scenario dimension and region, so the variable schema does not include a region designation. Required dimensions include time slice. This value is in the interval [0, 1] and is specified annually.",``capfac_elec_tech_$CAT-TECHNOLOGY$_$CAT-TIME-SLICE$``,,
Capacity of One Technology Unit,"Increment in which endogenously determined capacity is added for a technology (e.g., one unit of addition of this technology type will incurr some cost). This increment is in the specified unit of power. Varies by region and technology and is specified annually.",``caponetechunit_elec_tech_$CAT-TECHNOLOGY$_$UNIT-POWER$``,,
Capacity to Activity Unit,"Factor that relate a region's power unit to its energy unit (varies by technology). The factor has the units :math:`\frac{U_{energy}}{U_{power}YEAR}`, where :math:`U_{energy}` is the energy unit and :math:`U_{power}` is the energy unit.",``captoactivity_elec_tech_$CAT-TECHNOLOGY$_annual_$UNIT-ENERGY$_to_$UNIT-POWER$`` (``$UNIT-ENERGY$`` and ``$UNIT-POWER$`` are fixed),,See `NemoMod Units of Measure<https://sei-international.github.io/NemoMod.jl/stable/units/#uoms>`_ for more information
