Industrial Processes and Product Use
====================================

Variables by Category
---------------------

Industrial processes and product use is used exclusively to account for emissions from the industrial sector **excluding** industrial energy. Examples of emissions in IPPU include HFCs emitted from refrigeration, etc.


Categories
----------

Industry is divided into the following categories. These Note that emissions from and demand (**ELECTRIC UNITS HERE**) for `Industrial Energy <./energy.rst>`_ are accounted for in the energy sector. The categories enumerated below, however, are used to estimate those emissions and electrical demands.

All industrial categorization is derived from the *2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories*, Volume 3, *Industrial Processes* (see Chapter 1, page 1.7 for a chart describing these categorizations). The entire guidance is available from the `Task Force on National Greenhouse Gas Inventories <https://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2019rf/index.html>`_
